# Dorji-On-The-Go

Dorji On The Go is a Java-fx application built using Java. Customers who cannot go outside their homes can simply select their choice of clothing from our application and input their measurements
on our application to have the dress tailor-made for them. No more overfitting or underfitting!

I have worked on this project with my teammate Absara Chowdhury.

This project was completed for my university course CSE215: Objected Oriented Programming
