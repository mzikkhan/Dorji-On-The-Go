# Dorji-On-The-Go

In order to bring the tailor to your doorstep, we have created Dorji-On-The-Go. It is a Java-fx application built using Java. Customers
who cannot go outside their home can simply select their choice of clothing from our application and input their measurements
on our application to have the dress tailor-made for them. No more overfitting or underfitting!

I have worked on this project with my teammate Absara Chowdhury, she has been listed as a collaborator. We intend to transform this into a 
cross-platform application.
